# **AkuSiapSekolah : PAUD Developmental Assessment Website**

## Project Description:
This website is designed for parents, caregivers, and teachers of children aged 4-6 years old. It helps prepare them for elementary school by assessing motor skills (gross and fine motor) and personal-social development. The website contains a series of tests, and based on the results, it provides recommendations for activities that can be done at home to improve the child's development.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to provide parents and caregivers with tools to assess their child's readiness for school, particularly in motor skills and personal-social domains, using evidence-based practices to recommend improvement activities.

## How It Works:
- **Assessment Domains:** The website tests the childâ€™s motor (gross and fine) and personal-social skills.
- **Test Results & Recommendations:** After completing the tests, users will receive test results along with activity suggestions to improve any identified weaknesses based on their child's age.
